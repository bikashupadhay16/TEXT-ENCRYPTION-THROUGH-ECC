# TEXT-ENCRYPTION-THROUGH-ECC
The project aims to implement text encryption using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in an Android app. It involves generating ECC key pairs, encrypting and decrypting text messages, and ensuring secure communication between users by leveraging the cryptographic strength of ECC.
